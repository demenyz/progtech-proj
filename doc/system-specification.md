## About this document
We are accepted a commission of creating a fully functional food ordering application.  This document will describe the project under development.
## Project overview

## Technologies used
#### Environment – IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software. It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ), and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and in a proprietary commercial edition. Both can be used for commercial development.

#### Web server – Apache
An Apache web server will be used to store the database information, in which we will store the database writen in MySQL structure.

#### Programming language – JAVA
We are going to write our code in Java.

#### Communication – Discord, GitHub, Trello
Discord is a communication software made for voice chat. Since Discord is free we are gonna use this software, because it is not sure that all of us will be in the same room when our company develops the webshop the client asked for. With this we will be able to communicate in real time with our coding partners, and since it has a normal chat function that follows the written messages, it will be easy to trace back with the problems that are brought up during development.

GitHub is a free repository where the project will be stored during development. With this we can share and retrivel the versions of our work, and if something is not working we can reroll the changes so we don't have to start from the beginning.

Trello is a free web-based Kanban-style list-making application. We can create our task boards with several columns and move the tasks between them. Typically columns include task statuses: To Do, In Progress and Done.

#### Data structure store – MySQL
The database structure will be written accordig to the MySQL standards. Recommended version: MySQL 8.0
